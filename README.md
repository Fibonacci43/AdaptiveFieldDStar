AdaptiveFieldDStar
==================

Honours Project. Pathfinding with adaptive mesh refinement. The implementation of the Field D* algorithm in 2D and 2.5D triangle meshes with adaptive refinements. Weâ€™re aiming to perform local mesh refinements to produce a fine triangle mesh in areas traversed by a calculated path and iteratively improve the approximation of the path found using this dynamic scheme. We will be investigating the heuristics used by current pathfinding algorithms to direct node expansions in Field D*. Implemented in C++.
